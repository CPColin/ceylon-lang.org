Enrique started programming on a ZX81 at the age of 9, and has never stopped since. He's been in a love/hate relationship with Java since 2001, which has prompted him to try alternatives such as Groovy and Scala; now with Ceylon he has a chance not only to try a new language, but to help with its development.

Over the years he has published a few open-source projects, mainly:

- [jAlarms](http://jalarms.sourceforge.net/): An easy to use library to allow server-side apps to send alarms when something goes wrong
- [j8583](http://j8583.sourceforge.net/): A Java implementation of ISO8583
- [ScalaSQL](http://github.com/chochos/ScalaSQL/wiki): A simple interface between Scala and JDBC, similar to the Groovy Sql component

You can [follow him on G+](http://plus.google.com/115309975841842111009/about) or [twitter](http://twitter.com/chochosmx), or read his [blog](http://www.javamexico.org/blogs/ezamudio) (in Spanish) over at [javaMexico](http://javamexico.org/), a JUG in MÃ©xico where he's part of the staff.
