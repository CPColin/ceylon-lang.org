David is a Java programmer since year 2000 (after some years of C, C++, VB),
and is currently involved in several OpenSource projects on behalf of [SERLI](http://www.serli.com),
a french software development company strongly involved in the OpenSource
community.

He joined the Ceylon project in July 2011, and was affected on it on a full-time basis by SERLI for some months.
During this time he started the [Eclipse IDE integration](/documentation/1.0/ide) in order to help
providing a comprehensive IDE support for Milestone 1.
From this time, he's been regularly involved in the Ceylon project, specifically the IDE development, either on a part-time basis, or on a full-time basis.   

Ceylon work meets some of his technical interests among which we can find
software architecture, language analysis and transformation, and distributed systems.
