Lucas Werkmeister is a computer science student from Germany, who worked on
a [fractal explorer][JFractalizer], a [Geohashing app][wp_geohashing] and
an [EDID][EDID] editor in Java and C# before discovering Ceylon.
After some exploring, he almost turned away from Ceylon because the IDE had
no support for [code formatting][IDE#385] yet; instead, he was persuaded
to write a [formatter][ceylon.formatter] himself.
Since then, he's been doing more and more work in and on Ceylon, including
a [participation][ceylon.ast] in the 2014 Google Summer of Code.
