After studying electrical and computer engineering at the 
Georgia Institute of Technology, John Vasileff cofounded 
MarketingCentral, which became the leading provider of 
online collaboration and resource management software for 
marketers. MarketingCentral was acquired by Unica in 2007, 
and its core product is available today as IBM Marketing 
Operations OnDemand.

More recently, John has become somewhat obsessed developing 
with and contributing to the Ceylon language. He believes 
Ceylon is perhaps the most exciting new programming language 
available, possessing the rare combination of being 
incredibly advanced, easy to use, and easy to understand.
