After studying electrical and computer engineering at the 
Georgia Institute of Technology, John Vasileff cofounded 
MarketingCentral, which became the leading provider of 
online collaboration and resource management software for 
marketers. MarketingCentral was acquired by Unica in 2007, 
and its core product is available today as IBM Marketing 
Operations OnDemand.

More recently, John has become a huge fan of Ceylon and
enthusiastic contributor to the Ceylon project. He created
the (unofficial) Dart backend and the VSCode extension for
the Dart and Javascript backends, wrote the Whole, Random,
and TOML SDK modules, and has contributed numerous patches
and bug reports for the type checker and other parts of the
distribution.
