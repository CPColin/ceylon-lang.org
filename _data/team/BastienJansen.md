Bastien started programming around year 2002, he tried a few languages like C, PHP, and Ruby before
settling down in the Java world. In late 2012, while looking for a new project involving IntelliJ 
plugin development, he discovered Ceylon and decided that this fabulous language deserved a great IDE.

He started [Ceylon IDE for IntelliJ](https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-ide-intellij), and in mid-2015
he officially joined the Ceylon team to start working full-time on this project.
