Ivo wrote his first programs in AmigaBASIC and assembler but later became increasingly
interested in object-oriented programming. After many years with Java and C++,
he started exploring alternatives like Scala and D and finally came across Ceylon.
While his focus is on object-oriented design, he secretly likes bit shifting and
performance tuning. He lives in Germany.
