Aleš Justin is Sr. Principal Software Engineer at JBoss by Red Hat.

He joined JBoss in 2006 to work full time on the Microcontainer project. He currently leads CapeDwarf project, while still contributing to ApplicationServer, Weld, Arquillian and many other JBoss projects.

After realizing what Gavin's next gig was, he was eager to learn more and find a way to contribute. Ceylon's new modular runtime was perfect for this, given his kernel background, hence a prototype quickly emerged.
