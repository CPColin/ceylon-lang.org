Old enough to remember the ZX81 Tako Schotanus has spent an awful amount
of years programming in Java to please his corporate overlords but when
he heard about Ceylon he decided it was time to do his part for the good
of mankind (well at least for those in IT slaving away on the next website
for the latest cool product nobody is waiting for) and pitch in to make
Ceylon the best it can be.

Tako is Dutch but prefers the Spanish sun in Madrid where he now lives
(something that will surprise no one who really knows the Netherlands).

You can [follow him on G+](https://profiles.google.com/quintesse).
