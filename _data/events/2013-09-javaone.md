We will be doing several Ceylon-related talks at JavaOne this year, including:

### Write Your First Ceylon Program with the Language Authors

In this session, two Ceylon team members help you learn the Ceylon programming language, 
hand in hand, from downloading the tools to using the IDE, getting to know the various
tools and the language SDK, all the way to running your own module repository and
publishing your first Ceylon modules to it and to the official Ceylon module repository.

No knowledge of Ceylon is required, although the attendees should be familiar with the Java programming language.

This hands-on will take place on Monday, Sep 23, 12:30 PM - 2:30 PM - Hilton - Franciscan A/B/C/D.

### 99 Ceylon Idioms

Ceylon’s goals are to be a powerful, readable, and predictable programming language as well as a full platform
with modularity and tooling. But that´s not enough to describe the language. Come to this session to
explore a few of the things that make Ceylon much more pleasant than Java. Properties, modules, null safety,
class cast exceptions, dealing with collections, varargs, and generics: the presentation shows you the
many things Java developers will love in Ceylon.

This talk will take place on Monday, Sep 23, 8:30 PM - 9:15 PM - Hilton - Yosemite B/C.

### The Emerging Languages Bowl: The Quest to Be in the Big Leagues

Scripting languages that are emerging and not yet mainstream vie with each other to stake a claim
that they have the potential to become mainstream and be considered to be in the big leagues.
Don’t miss this panel discussion, in which these emerging languages are portrayed by their respective champions,
who explain how they may help your everyday life as a Java developer. To present a complete picture,
the session includes some languages that may not run on the JVM. Afterward you will have a better grasp of
the emerging languages and the ecosystem. One or more of the languages may catch your fancy for doing development alongside Java.

This session will take place on Thursday, Sep 26, 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM - Hilton - Yosemite B/C.
