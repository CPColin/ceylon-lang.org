Come to learn all about the new Ceylon programming language: how it's different, what you can do with it and how it helps from 
development to deployment.

Ceylon is a new modern, elegant programming language for the JVM and JavaScript VM, designed for team work. But it's more than 
that, it is a full platform with modularity, an SDK, tools and IDEs.

We will present Ceylon the language, the platform, and its ecosystem. You will see everything from starting a new project in 
the IDE to publishing it on Herd, our module repository, including using the SDK. We will also discuss the ongoing Ceylon 
projects such as the build system, Vert.x integration or Cayla, the new web framework.

Finally we will discuss the plans for Ceylon 1.1, 1.2 and further.


This talk will be in Thursday, September 11th 2014 at 13:00–14:00 in Room 3.
