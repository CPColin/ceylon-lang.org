Ceylon's goals are to be a powerful, readable and predictable programming language as well as a full platform with modularity and tooling.
But thatÂ´s not enough to describe the language.

Come join us to explore a few of the things that makes Ceylon much more pleasant than Java. Properties, modules, null safety,
class cast exceptions, dealing with collections, varargs or generics: we'll show you the many things Java developers will love in Ceylon.

The exact date is not yet fixed, we will update this place when available.
