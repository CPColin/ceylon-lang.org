Emmanuel and Stephane will be doing two Ceylon talks at Devoxx FR 2013, in Paris, France.

On the first day of Devoxx University, we are going to do a [hands-on lab](http://www.devoxx.com/display/FR13/Les+mains+dans+le+Ceylon+++venez+coder+avec+les+auteurs+du+langage)
where we teach you how to get started with Ceylon, from writing your first code to publishing modules.

And on the third day, Emmanuel and I will [present Ceylon from a features perspective](http://www.devoxx.com/display/FR13/99+recettes+de+Ceylon),
detailing example by example why Java developers will love it and feel right at home (at least a _new_ home).

Don't forget to come!
