Emmanuel and St√©phane will introduce the main features of Ceylon, why you should care 
and also show both the compiler and IDE progress via a live demo. They will also tell you
what is new since the first milestone release. **Not only that but they will speak French!**

The session will take place on Thursday 19 April 2012 at 17:00 - 18:00 in the _Miles Davis_
room.
