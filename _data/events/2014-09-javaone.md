We will be doing several Ceylon-related talks at JavaOne this year, including:

### Ceylon from Here to Infinity: The Big Picture and What’s Coming [CON3078]

Ceylon is a new modern, elegant programming language for the JVM and the JavaScript VM, designed for teamwork. 
But it’s more than that: it is a full platform with modularity, an SDK, tools, and IDEs. 

This session presents Ceylon the language, the platform, and its ecosystem. You will see everything from starting 
a new project in the IDE to publishing it on Herd, Ceylon’s module repository, including using the SDK. 
The presentation also discusses ongoing Ceylon projects such as the build system; Vert.x integration; and Cayla, 
the new web framework. Finally, it looks at the plans for Ceylon 1.1, 1.2, and further.

This talk will take place on Tuesday, Sep 30, 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM - Hilton - Continental Ballroom 7/8/9.

### The Emerging Languages Bowl: The Big League Challenge [CON4388]

Scripting languages that are emerging and not yet mainstream vie with each other to stake a claim that they have the potential 
to become mainstream and be regarded as big-league. Don’t miss this panel discussion, in which these emerging languages are 
portrayed by their respective champions, who explain how they may help your everyday life as a Java developer. To present a 
complete picture, the session includes some languages that may not run on the JVM. Afterward you will have a better grasp of
the emerging languages and the ecosystem. One or more of the languages may catch your fancy for doing development alongside Java.

This talk will take place on Wednesday, Oct 1, 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM - Hilton - Continental Ballroom 7/8/9.
