### Ceylon from Here to Infinity: The Big Picture and What’s Coming

Ceylon is a new modern, elegant programming language for the JVM and the JavaScript VM, designed for teamwork. 
But it’s more than that: it is a full platform with modularity, an SDK, tools, and IDEs. 

This session presents Ceylon the language, the platform, and its ecosystem. You will see everything from starting 
a new project in the IDE to publishing it on Herd, Ceylon’s module repository, including using the SDK. 
The presentation also discusses ongoing Ceylon projects such as the build system; Vert.x integration; and Cayla, 
the new web framework. Finally, it looks at the plans for Ceylon 1.2, and further.
