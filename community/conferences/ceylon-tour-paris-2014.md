# #{page.title}

The Ceylon community is proud to organise the first Ceylon Tour conference in Paris on Friday the 24th of January 2014.

## What is it?

It is a Ceylon conference, for an entire day, free, located in Paris. We will have most of the Ceylon core team, and
members of the Ceylon community, who will give short talks and a workshop. Whether you don't know Ceylon yet, or want
to know more, this is the place to be. We will present many aspects of the Ceylon language and ecosystem, as well as
discuss the future of Ceylon.

Naturally, the conference should be a place of exchange and discussions, so we expect as much value between the talks
as during the presentations.

## The program

The morning will start with the following talks (program not set in stone yet), between 9h-12h:

- Introduction to Ceylon (30 minutes)
- The power behind Ceylon (30 minutes)
- Ceylon IDE presentation (10 minutes)
- Guide to the Ceylon command-line (10 minutes)
- Using Herd: the Ceylon online repository (10 minutes)
- The Ceylon build system: ceylon.build (10 minutes)
- What's in the Ceylon SDK (10 minutes)
- Cayla: a Ceylon web framework (10 minutes)
- Interoperability with Java (10 minutes)
- Interoperability with JavaScript (10 minutes)
- Contributing to Ceylon, setting up a dev environment (10 minutes)
- The Ceylon test framework: ceylon.test (10 minutes)
- How do you write Ceylon documentation? (10 minutes)
- Module repositories explained (10 minutes)
- Ceylon and Camel (10 minutes)
- The road ahead for Ceylon 1.1 and 1.2 (30 minutes)

Then we expect a lunch break and a workshop in the afternoon, between 14h-18h, where we take you
hand-in-hand and make you discover all the great features of the Ceylon language and ecosystem.

## Location

The conference will take place at the Inria Paris offices on Place d'Italie:
