# #{page.title}

The website home page has an automatically filled news section.

When you want to advertize a news, add a file `yyyy-mm-some-text.md` under `_data/news` with the following structure

<!-- lang: none -->

    title: 'My exciting news'
    date: 29 August, 2011
    more_info_url: /my/url/with/more/details

    Some exciting news today.

A typical example would be `2011-08-news-section.md`

<!-- lang: none -->
    ---
    title: 'News section is up'
    date: 29 August, 2011
    more_info_url: /blog/2011-08-29-news-section/
    effective_date: 20110829

    The website news section is now up.

### Note

We could have reused blog entries tagged `#news` but most of the time, the first 50 characters of a
blog entry are not useful enough. So I've decided to go for the explicit `_data/news` structure.
