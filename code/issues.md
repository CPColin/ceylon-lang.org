We use GitHub's issue tracker. If you have found a bug or have an 
enhancement proposal, open an issue.

There is a dedicated issue tracker for:

- [the distribution: compiler, runtime, language module, specification][ceylon],
- the IDE:
  - [the Eclipse-based IDE][ceylon-ide-eclipse],
  - [the IntelliJ-based IDE][ceylon-ide-intellij], and
  - [common components for both IDEs][ceylon-ide-common] 
    (when in doubt, open an issue for a specific IDE, and it may be 
    moved here if applicable),
- [the platform modules][ceylon-sdk] belonging to the Ceylon SDK,
- [Ceylon Herd][ceylon-herd], and
- [this website][].

If your issue doesn't fall into one of these categories, it might be 
better to send email to the [development mailing list][ceylon-dev].
