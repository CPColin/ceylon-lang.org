We're working hard to make Eclipse Ceylon awesome. You can help by 
trying out the latest release and contributing bug reports or 
code.

## Licenses

Our code is open source, [read more](licenses).

## Looking for nightly builds?

You can download pre-release builds of Ceylon (distribution, SDK, IDEs) on our
[Continuous Integration server](https://ci-ceylon.rhcloud.com/).

## Get the source, start hacking

Ceylon language, the compiler, the class libraries, or the IDE? 
Contact us on our 
[dev mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ceylon-dev).

Want to get your hands on the code? Read how to access 
[the source](source).

Feeling adventurous and want to help us with the compiler 
backend? Read [how to work on that project](contribute).
