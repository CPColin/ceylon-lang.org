# #{page.title}

You'll find all you need to know about Ceylon in these pages. Ceylon itself is 
a work in progress, so this documentation is still in a state of flux. By the way, 
_you_ can help improve it, [read more](/code/website).

## New to Ceylon?

The [quick introduction](introduction) summarizes some of what Ceylon is all about.

Still interested? The [tour of Ceylon](/documentation/tour) will guide you through 
the main features and syntax of Ceylon in some depth. Currently, this is the best 
way to learn Ceylon.

## Reference

Need to clarify some detail of the language, language module, or tooling? Try the 
[reference](reference) page.

Or, if you want to be absolutely certain, you can dive into the [language specification](spec)
- the gospel according to Ceylon.

The API documentation for the Ceylon Language Module `ceylon.language` is
[also available](api/current/ceylon/language).
