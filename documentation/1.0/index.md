# #{page.title}

You'll find all you need to know about Ceylon in these pages. Just like the
code we write, all the information here is [open source](/code/licenses).

Oh, and if something is missing or isn't right, please 
[help us improve it](/code/website). 

## New to Ceylon?

The [quick introduction](introduction) summarizes some of what Ceylon is all 
about.

Still interested? The [tour of Ceylon](tour) will guide you through the main 
features and syntax of Ceylon in some depth. Currently, this is the best way 
to learn Ceylon.

If you want to get your hands a little dirty, the [walkthrough](walkthrough) 
is a guided set of exercises introducing many of the basic features of the 
language.

## Reference

Need to clarify some detail of the language, language module, or tooling? 
Try the [reference](reference) page.

Or, if you want to be absolutely certain, you can dive into the 
[language specification](spec)&mdash;the gospel according to Ceylon.

## Module APIs

You can find the API documentation for modules, including platform modules, 
in [Herd](http://modules.ceylon-lang.org/). The API documentation for the 
Ceylon Language Module `ceylon.language` is 
[right here](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/index.html).

## Tools

You can find information about [Ceylon IDE](ide) and how to 
[install it](ide/install).

There is even [Vim support](resources/vim) available.

## Got questions? We have FAQs

We're compiling a list of common questions. Check out the [FAQs](faq). 

If you want to know why Ceylon is the way it is&mdash;_what the hell were we 
thinking?!_&mdash;the [language design FAQ](faq/language-design) is especially 
interesting.

## Roadmap

Want to know when to expect what? We can't promise dates, but we do have a 
[roadmap](roadmap).
