# Tour of Ceylon

This tour introduces the Ceylon language to developers with
some experience in object-oriented programming. It assumes
familiarity with concepts like static typing, inheritance, 
subtyping, and type parameterization (generics). If you 
already know a language like Java, C#, or C++, you already
have all the background you need.

If you're new to object-oriented programming, you'll still
be able to learn Ceylon. These concepts aren't difficult to
pick up! But you might find some chapters of the tour pretty
hard going first time through. If so, take it slowly: 
experiment with the language using [Ceylon IDE](../ide), and 
gradually get a feel for how these things work and how they 
are useful. None of us learned to program from books or 
tutorials or from other people telling us how to do it. We 
learned by playing and experimenting.

If you're completely new to static typing, you'll probably
find Ceylon a bit fussy and complicated at first. There's a
lot more rules to know about than in a language like Python,
Ruby, or Smalltalk. But we promise that the benefits are worth 
it in the end, especially once you learn to use the IDE 
effectively. Tooling for dynamic languages simply can't reason
about your code like Ceylon IDE can! 

## Before you start

If you're using the [command line distribution](/download) to
try out Ceylon for the first time, we highly recommend you 
start by compiling and running the samples included in the
distribution.

Instructions for getting started are contained in the file
`README.md` in the root directory of the distribution, or
[right here in GitHub][ceylon-dist readme].

### implementation note <!-- m5 -->

Not every language feature described here has been implemented 
in M5. Where this is the case, you'll see an "implementation note", 
explaining when you can expect to be able to use the feature.
