# Tour of Ceylon

This tour covers the main features of the Ceylon language. Note 
that not every language feature described here has been implemented
at this time.

## Before you start

If you're using the [command line distribution](/download) to
try out Ceylon for the first time, we highly recommend you 
start by compiling and running the samples included in the
distribution.

Instructions for getting started are contained in the file
`README.md` in the root directory of the distribution, or
[right here in GitHub][ceylon-dist readme].
