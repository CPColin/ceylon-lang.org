## Usage 

A `Character` literal is a single character enclosed between backticks (`\``), 
for example:


    Character x = `x`;
    Character backtick = `\``;

## Description

### Unicode characters

Since Ceylon source files are preprocessed for unicode escapes prior to parsing
you can use unicode escapes within character literals, like this:


    Character therefore = `\u2234`; // an escaped Unicode therefore symbol

### Escaping

Backslash is used as an escape character. The following characters must be 
escaped when they're used in a `Character` literal:

* backtick ( \` ), escaped as \`\
* backslash (`\`), escaped as `\\`
* tab, escaped as `\t`
* formfeed, escaped as `\f`
* newline, escaped as `\n`
* return, escaped as `\r`
* backspace, escaped as `\b`

In addition, the following may be escaped with a backslash:

* single quote (`'`), escaped as `\'`
* double quote (`"`), escaped as `\"`
