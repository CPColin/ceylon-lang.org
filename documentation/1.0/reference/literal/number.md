## Usage 

A `Number` literal can be written an a variety of ways

    Number one = 1;
    variable Number oneMillion := 1000000;
    oneMillion := 1_000_000;
    oneMillion := 1M;

## Description

At its simplest, a `Number` literal is just a series of decimal digits, 
`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8` and `9`. Other digit characters 
(digits from other scripts) are not allowed.

Number literals with a leading zero (`0`) are allowed, but unlike other 
C-like programming languages such numbers are *not* treated as octal. 
Neither octal nor hexadecimal notation is supported using the literal format.

To ease reading long number literals, groups of three digits may be separated 
with an underscore (`_`), similar to how a comma or stop is used as a thousands
separator in many written numbers. Only the left-most group may have one or 
two digits.

Use of one of the following metric magnitudes as a suffix is supported:

* `k` (kilo), 10<sup>3</sup>
* `M` (mega), 10<sup>6</sup>
* `G` (giga), 10<sup>9</sup>
* `T` (tera), 10<sup>12</sup>
* `P` (peta), 10<sup>15</sup>

Ceylon does not have direct support for negative literals. If a negative number 
is required, the [unary minus](../../operator/unary_minus) operator can be used 
in the  declaration of the `Integer`, like this:

    Integer minusTwo = -2;
