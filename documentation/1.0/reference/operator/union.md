# #{page.title}

The left-associative, binary `|` operator is used to compute the 
*union* of two operands.

## Usage 

    Integer two = 1 | 2;

## Description

The `|` operator is also commonly used to [union types](/documentation/reference/structure/type), 
so that the declared entity is assignable to either (or one) of the given types:

    Foo|Bar fooOrBar;

### Definition

The `|` operator is defined as follows:

    lhs.or(rhs)

See the [language specification](#{site.urls.spec}#slotwise) for 
more details.

### Polymorphism

The `|` operator is [polymorphic](/documentation/reference/operator/operator-polymorphism). 
The meaning of `|` depends on the 
[`Slots`](#{site.urls.apidoc}/ceylon/language/interface_Slots.html) interface
