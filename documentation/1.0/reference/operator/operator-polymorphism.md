## Description

### Primitive and polymorphic operators

Almost all of the operators in Ceylon can be expressed in terms of 
methods defined on classes and/or interfaces in the language module. 
Those operators which do not have such a definition are called 
*primitive* operators. The primitive operators are:

* `.` (member), 
* `:=` (assignment), 
* `is`, 
* `()` (positional invocation),
* `{}` (named argument invocation)

Many non-primitive operators are *polymorphic*, which means that it is 
possible to specify the behaviour of operators in a type-specific way by 
satisfying the interface(s) used in the operator's definition.

Not all non-primitive operators are polymorphic. Some are defined only in 
terms of the primitive operators, for example.

### Simple Example

A simple example might be writing a complex number class which implements
`Invertable`, `Number`, `Numeric`, `Castable`  and `Equality`. 
This would allow you to write expressions using the 
operators `+` (unary plus), `-` (unary minus), 
`+` (sum), `-` (difference), `*` (product), `/` (quotient),
`==` (equality) and `!=` (inequality). For example

    void m(Complex z) {
        Complex a = Complex(1, 2); // 1 + 2i
        Complex b = Complex(4, 2); // 4 + 2i
        Complex c = Complex(0, 1); // i
        Complex d = a * b + c;
        if (d == z) {
            print("" d "==" z "");
        } else {
            print("" d "!=" z "");
        }
    }

### Identities

There are certain *identities* which are true of numbers (and of the built-in
numeric types), which may not hold with arbitrary types. 

As an example variables `x` and `y` of a type `T` which has overridden 
`Invertable` and `Numeric`; according to the rules of arithmetic the 
following identity *should* apply:

<pre>
    <i>x</i> - <i>y</i> â‰¡ <i>x</i> + (-<i>y</i>)
</pre>

Ceylon does not (and cannot) check whether the above identity holds for 
`T`'s implementation of `Invertable` and `Numeric`. 

### Advice

The single most important thing to remember is that 
**if an identity does not apply for `T` then you cannot use that identity to 
rewrite expressions involving `T`**.

Philosphically, the operator symbols are just notation and Ceylon simply
defines how those operators work in terms of the various interfaces. It's up 
to the author of a class to decide what those symbols ought to
mean for that class, *bearing in mind those symbols have a conventional meaning*.

Pragmatically, that same author would be ill-advised to try giving radically 
different meanings to those operators: Doing so will only confuse 
people.

Our advice is that if a type has a notion of arithmetic (or whatever) 
which closely conforms to numerical arithmetic, then by all means implement 
`Numeric` (or whatever). If you do, then document clearly any identities which 
do not hold. 

If on the other hand, the type *doesn't* have some notion of arithmetic, then 
*don't* confuse people by making operators do funky things: Plain old method 
calls will be clearest.

The user of a class which implements the various operator interfaces is 
advised to be cautious about assuming the truth of identities which are not 
documented as being satisfied.
