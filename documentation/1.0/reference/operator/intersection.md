# #{page.title}

The left-associative, binary `&` operator is used to compute the 
*intersection* of its operands.

## Usage 

    Integer one = 1 & 2;

## Description

The operator is also commonly used to [intersect types] _doc coming soon at_ (/documentation/reference/structure/type), 
so that the declared entity is assignable to both (or all) of the given types:

    Foo&Bar foobar;

### Definition

The `&` operator is defined as follows:

    lhs.and(rhs)

See the [language specification](#{site.urls.spec}#slotwise) for 
more details.

### Polymorphism

The `&` operator is [polymorphic](/documentation/reference/operator/operator-polymorphism). 
The meaning of `&` depends on the 
[`Slots`](#{site.urls.apidoc}/ceylon/language/interface_Slots.html) interface
