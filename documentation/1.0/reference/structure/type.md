# #{page.title}

In Ceylon, a type declaration is one of:

* A [`class` declaration](../../types/class)
* An [`interface` declaration](../../types/interface)
* An [`object` declaration](../../types/object)

## Usage 



## Description

In general types can be declared at the top level, or nested within another 
type. The exception to this is that an interface cannot have an `object` member.
