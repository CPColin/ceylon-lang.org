# #{page.title}

A block is a series of statements that are executed sequentially, in the order 
they occur.

## Usage 

A block is simply a list of statements enclosed in braces `{` and `}`.

Class, function, getter, and setter definitions are all defined using blocks of 
statements. The `if`, `for`, `switch`, `try`, and `while` statements also involve 
blocks.
