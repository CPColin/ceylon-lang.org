# #{page.title}

The `while` statement supports iteration.

## Usage 

The general form of the `while` statement is


    while ( /* condition */ ) {
        /* while block */
    }
    /* code after while statement */


## Description

### Execution

A `while` statement executes a block of code repeatedly until the 
*while condition* evaluates as `false` (or the block it exited via a 
`return`, `throw` or `break` directive).

### `break` and `continue`

Within the `while` block the [`break` directive](../break/) can be used to 
exit the block early without waiting for the condition to become `false`.

The [`continue` directive](../continue/) can be used to skip execution of
the remainder of the block and proceed with the execution of the block.

### Unsupported features

In Ceylon there is no `do`/`while` statement.
