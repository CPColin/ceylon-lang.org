The Ceylon IDE is a plugin for [Eclipse][eclipse]. The IDE project was 
initiated by David Festal from [SERLI](http://www.serli.com/), a french 
software company contributing to the Ceylon project.

## Features

You can find out what Ceylon IDE has to offer, together with screenshots,
on the [IDE features page](features). Of course, the best way to learn
what the IDE provides is to [install it](install).

## License

Like everything we produce, Ceylon IDE is [open source](/code/licenses).

## Running the IDE

You'll need a clean install of [Eclipse 4.3 Kepler][eclipse] or of 
[Eclipse 4.2 Juno][juno] running on Java 7. 

Install Ceylon IDE (which includes the Ceylon compiler) from our 
[Eclipse plugin update site](install).

<!--
You can install Ceylon IDE (which includes the Ceylon compiler) either:

* from our [Eclipse plugin update site](install), or 
* from Eclipse Marketplace by dragging and dropping this button into 
  a running Eclipse Indigo workspace:
