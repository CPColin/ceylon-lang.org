# #{page.title_md}

The ceylon tools use a `git`-like plugin scheme for declaring new subcommands.

## What is a Ceylon CLI plugin?

If you have any executable in your path (`$PATH` on Unices, `%PATH%` on Windows) whose
name starts with `ceylon-` and is executable, then the `ceylon` command will detect it
and make it available as a subcommand.

For example, the `ceylon-format` executable will be picked up by the `ceylon` CLI tool
as a `format` subcommand, which means you can invoke it with `ceylon format`:

<!-- lang:shell -->
    $ ceylon --help format
    NAME
    
            'ceylon format' - format Ceylon source code
    
    
    SYNOPSIS
    
            ceylon format [OPTION]... ( FILE [--and FILE]... [--to FILE] )...
    ...

## Installing new CLI plugins

You can install the CLI plugin scripts packaged for the module `ceylon.formatter` with:

<!-- lang:shell -->
    $ ceylon plugin install ceylon.formatter/1.2.1

This will install the `ceylon-format` plugin script to `~/.ceylon/bin/ceylon.formatter/ceylon-format`
where the ceylon CLI will look for plugins, as well as from your `PATH` environment variable.

Naturally, you can also manually install plugins in your `PATH`.

You can list every plugin installed with:

<!-- lang:shell -->
    $ ceylon plugin list
    ceylon-build (ceylon.build.engine)
    ceylon-format (ceylon.formatter)

And finally, you can uninstall plugins with:

<!-- lang:shell -->
    $ ceylon plugin uninstall ceylon.formatter

## Writing Ceylon CLI plugins

Suppose we want to write a `compile-doc` plugin which runs the JVM and JS compilers, then the
API documentation. We will call the file `ceylon-compile-doc` for Unices, with the following
contents:

<!-- lang:shell -->
    #!/bin/sh
    
    USAGE='[any option valid for compile, compile-js and doc]'
    DESCRIPTION='Runs both compilers and the doc tool'
    LONG_USAGE='This will run the `compile`, `compile-js` and `doc` subcommands.
    
    OPTIONS
    
    Any option that is accepted by all of the `compile`, `compile-js` and `doc`
    subcommands.'
    
    . $CEYLON_HOME/bin/ceylon-sh-setup
    
    $CEYLON compile $@
    $CEYLON compile-js $@
    $CEYLON doc $@

As you can see, you need to specify a number of shell variables:

- `USAGE` will be used to document the command-line arguments your plugin accepts,
- `DESCRIPTION` will be used to describe your plugin in `ceylon --help`, and
- `LONG_USAGE` will be used to document your plugin in `ceylon compile-doc --help`.

These variables will then be used in the `ceylon-sh-setup` script which you should invoke,
which will handle exiting from your script when there are `--help` parameters on the command-line
to pass them back to the command-line system.

Once youâ€™ve defined those documentation variables and invoked the `ceylon-sh-setup` script, you can
what you want in the script.

On Windows, your script will be named `ceylon-format.bat` and look like:

<!-- lang:shell -->
    @echo off
    set "USAGE=[any option valid for compile, compile-js and doc]"
    set "DESCRIPTION=Runs both compilers and the doc tool"
    set "LONG_USAGE=This will run the `compile`, `compile-js` and `doc` subcommands."
    set "LONG_USAGE=%LONG_USAGE%"
    set "LONG_USAGE=%LONG_USAGE%OPTIONS"
    set "LONG_USAGE=%LONG_USAGE%"
    set "LONG_USAGE=%LONG_USAGE%Any option that is accepted by all of the `compile`, `compile-js` and `doc`"
    set "LONG_USAGE=%LONG_USAGE%subcommands."
    
    call %CEYLON_HOME%\bin\ceylon-sh-setup.bat %*
    
    if "%errorlevel%" == "1" (
        exit /b 0
    )
    %CEYLON% compile %*
    %CEYLON% compile-js %*
    %CEYLON% doc %*


## Environment variables given to your script

There are a number of predefined environment variables that the `ceylon` CLI will pass to your
script:

- `CEYLON_HOME` will point to the Ceylon distribution root folder,
- `JAVA_HOME` will point to the current JDK/JRE root folder,
- `CEYLON_VERSION_MAJOR` contains the current Ceylon version major part (`Maj` in `Maj.Min.Rel`),
- `CEYLON_VERSION_MINOR` contains the current Ceylon version minor part (`Min` in `Maj.Min.Rel`),
- `CEYLON_VERSION_RELEASE` contains the current Ceylon version release part (`Rel` in `Maj.Min.Rel`),
- `CEYLON_VERSION` contains the current Ceylon version major part (`Maj.Min.Rel (Name)`),
- `CEYLON_VERSION_NAME` contains the current ceylon version code name,
- `SCRIPT` is the absolute path to your plugin script, and
- `SCRIPT_DIR` is the absolute path to the directory containing your plugin script. 

## Packaging scripts to make them available for users

CLI plugin scripts for the module `your.module` should be put in the `script/your/module` folder 
by convention, although you can override this with the `--script` option.

You can generate a script package for the module `your.module` with:

<!-- lang:shell -->
    $ ceylon plugin pack your.module

Naturally, you can publish your plugins as part of your module to Herd, so that they are available to
users.
