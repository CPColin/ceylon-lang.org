After a full year in development, and with more than 
[1500 issues][issues] closed, [Ceylon 1.2.0][download] 
brings new language features, including:

- constructors,
- serialization,
- `native` declarations,
- improved flow-sensitive typing,
- destructuring for tuples and entries
- `let`, `switch`, `if`, and `object` expressions, and
- more powerful annotation constraints.

Also part of this release are enhancements to the tooling, 
such as:

- a new debugger for Ceylon, and
- the Java EE packaging command, `ceylon war`.

As always, this release incorporates hundreds of other 
bugfixes and enhancements.

## About Ceylon

Ceylon is a modern, modular, statically typed programming 
language for the Java and JavaScript virtual machines. The
language features a flexible and very readable syntax, a 
unique and uncommonly elegant static type system, a powerful 
module architecture, and excellent tooling, including an 
awesome Eclipse-based IDE.

Ceylon enables the development of cross-platform modules 
that execute portably in both virtual machine environments. 
Alternatively, a Ceylon module may target one or the other 
platform, in which case it may interoperate with native code 
written for that platform.

## In the box

[This release][download] includes:

- a complete [language specification][spec] that defines the 
  syntax and semantics of Ceylon in language accessible to 
  the professional developer,
- a [command line toolset][toolset] including compilers for 
  Java and JavaScript, a documentation compiler, a test 
  runner, a WAR archive packager, and support for executing 
  modular programs on the JVM and Node.js,
- a powerful module architecture for code organization,
  dependency management, and module isolation at runtime,
- the [language module][ceylon.language], our minimal, 
  cross-platform foundation of the [Ceylon SDK][sdk], and
- a [full-featured][ide features] Eclipse-based integrated 
  development environment.

## Language

Ceylon is a highly understandable object-oriented language 
with static typing. The language features:

- an emphasis upon __readability__ and a strong bias toward 
  __omission or elimination of potentially-harmful or 
  potentially-ambiguous constructs__ and toward highly 
  __disciplined use of static types__,
- an extremely powerful and uncommonly elegant type system 
  combining subtype and parametric polymorphism with:
  - first-class __union and intersection types__, 
  - both __declaration-site and use-site variance__, and
  - the use of principal types for __local type inference__ 
    and __flow-sensitive typing__,
- a unique treatment of __function and tuple types__, 
  enabling powerful abstractions, along with the most 
  __elegant approach to `null`__ of any modern language, 
- first-class constructs for defining __modules and 
  dependencies between modules__,
- a very flexible syntax including __comprehensions__ and 
  support for expressing __tree-like structures__,
- __fully-reified generic types__, on both the JVM and
  JavaScript virtual machines, and a unique __typesafe 
  metamodel__.

More information about these language features may be
found in the [feature list](/features) and 
[quick introduction][quick-intro].

This release introduces the following new language features
and improvements:

- named __constructors__,
- support for __serialization__ libraries in the metamodel,
- the `native` annotation, which allows the use of 
  platform-dependent code in cross-platform modules 
- improvements to __flow-sensitive typing__,
- __destructuring__ for tuples and entries,
- `let`, `switch`, and `if` expressions,
- inline `object` expressions,
- more powerful __annotation constraints__,
- type argument inference for __function references__,
- an improved algorithm for type argument inference in 
  __invocation expressions__,
- improvements to analysis of __disjointness for sequence 
  types__,
- new __type abbreviations__, `T[N]` and `T(*A)`,
- an abbreviated syntax for identifying the containing 
  `` `package` ``, `` `module` ``, `` `class` ``, or
  `` `interface` ``,
- inline variable defininition in `switch`
- the ability to directly `import` members of a singleton 
  `object`,
- __relaxation of type constraint checking__ where 
  unnecessary to ensure soundness, and
- experimental support for __type functions__ (higher-order
  and higher-rank polymorphism).

## Language module

For Ceylon 1.2, the following new APIs were introduced to
the language module:

- the `map()` and `set()` functions allow creation of
  immutable `Map`s and `Set`s with no dependency to
  `ceylon.collection`,
- `distinct`, `frequences()`, `group()`, `tabulate()`, and
  `summarize()` were added to `Iterable`,
- `getOrDefault()`, `defaultNullItems()`, and `coalescedMap` 
  were added to `Map`, 
- `Collection.permutations()` was added, 
- `formatFloat()` was added,
- the `Contextual` interface was added, a cross-platform
  abstraction of thread-local values,
- some operations of `List` were split out onto the new 
  `SearchableList` interface, and
- `arrayOfSize()` was deperecated and replaced with the
  constructor `Array.ofSize()`.

Furthermore, some native implementation code has been 
rewritten in Ceylon using `native`.

## Compiler and command line tools

Enhancements to the Java compiler include:

- much improved interoperation with Maven, including support
  for overriding module metadata with `overrides.xml`, and
  `--flat-classpath` and `--auto-export-maven-dependencies`,
- all compiled classes are now `Serializable` and have 
  default constructors, allowing much smoother 
  interoperation with certain Java frameworks,
- improved interoperation with Java annotations, and
- basic support for interoperation with libraries written in 
  Scala.

The JavaScript compiler now supports type functions, allowing
the use of higher-order and higher-rank polymorphism in 
Ceylon. These experimental features are not yet supported by
the Java compiler.

There are several new features and improvements to the 
command line toolset:

- the `ceylon war` command repackages a module as a Java EE
  WAR archive,
- the `ceylon browse` command opens module documentation in
  the browser, 
- multiple commands can be given simultaneously, for example
  `ceylon compile,doc,run com.redhat.hello`,
- `ceylon help command` and `ceylon --help` now page output
  by default, and 
- the `ceylon` command architecture now supports writing 
  plugins in Ceylon.

## IDE

Ceylon IDE now features the following improvements, along
with many bugfixes and a number of performance enhancements:

- a brand new __debugger__ for Ceylon,
- extensive support for new language features including
  constructors and `native`,
- improvements to the powerful __Change Parameter List__ 
  refactoring,
- the Inline refactoring can now __inline a type alias__, 
- __filtering__ of packages from searches and completions,
- many new __quick fixes and assists__,
- __Paste Java as Ceylon__,
- the popup Outline can now show inherited members,
- the redesigned Open Declaration dialog now shows 
  documentation,
- __keyboard shortcuts__ were added for certain quick assists,
- support for Eclipse's new __dark theme__,
- refactored preferences pages, wih much __greater
  customizability__, including
- two new __alternative syntax highlighting themes__, along 
  with an alternative icon set.

A number of important subsystems have been abstracted and
rewritten in Ceylon, to support the ongoing development of
the new IntelliJ-based IDE for Ceylon.

## SDK

The [platform modules][sdk], recompiled for 1.2.0, are 
available in the shared community repository, [Ceylon Herd][].

This release introduces two new platform modules:

- `ceylon.transaction` provides support for distributed 
  transaction processing, and
- `ceylon.regex` provides regular expressions.

Along with several API enhancements and bugfixes, including:

- `ceylon.time` now has functions for parsing ISO 8601 
  formatted dates, times, and datetimes,
- `ceylon.locale` now supports formatting zoned times, and
  parsing dates and times,
- `ceylon.interop.java` now has `javaClassFromDeclaration()`,
- `ceylon.net` now has `redirect()`, and its `Uri` is now 
  immutable, and
- the collection types in `ceylon.collection` now offer 
  additional named constructors.

## OpenShift cartridge

The [Ceylon cartridge][] for [OpenShift][] has been improved
and updated to support Ceylon 1.2.

## Web IDE

You can try Ceylon using the redesigned [Web IDE][], now 
rewritten in Ceylon, and featuring syntax highlighting, 
interactive error reporting, autocompletion, online 
documentation, and persistence and code sharing via Gist.

The Web IDE serves a dual purpose as a standard example
demonstrating the use of Ceylon for web application 
development and deployment to the OpenShift cloud platform.
