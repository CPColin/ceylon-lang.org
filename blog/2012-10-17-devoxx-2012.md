Feel like learning Ceylon but you don´t know how to get started? You want to start contributing to Ceylon?

Don´t worry, we´ve got you covered. Gavin, Emmanuel and I will be at Devoxx Belgium 2012 for two important gigs.

## Hands-On Lab on Monday 12th of November

_This is the best place to feel what Ceylon is like_.

On Monday 12th of November we are holding a [Hands-On Lab](http://devoxx.com/display/DV12/Write+your+first+Ceylon+program+with+the+language+authors)
where you will write your first Ceylon programs with a series of guided
exercises. **Come with your laptop**, we will help you install the Ceylon IDE.
This should be interesting, after all: the language authors
and implementers will be there to answer your every question.

## HackerGarten on Tuesday 13th of November

_This is the best place to start contributing_.

On Tuesday 13th of November we will be holding a [full-day HackerGarten](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/2012/09/25/More+Space+and+Content)
with the [rest of the JBoss team](http://lanyrd.com/2012/devoxx/syzdq/). Here we will not only help you get started with coding in Ceylon but also help you get
started with contributing to the Ceylon project, and its many sub-projects.

If you want to contribute but don´t
know how to get started, Gavin, Emmanuel and I will be there to guide you.
And contrary to popular belief, none of us have bitten anyone in the last... four months at least!
**Come with your laptop**, that would not be fun otherwise.

## Some planning required

Make sure to [register for the University part of Devoxx](https://reg.devoxx.com/): there are still tickets left.
Also remember to bring your laptop for both those occasions.

Install JDK 7.  We´ll provide everything else required 
via WiFi or USB keys.
