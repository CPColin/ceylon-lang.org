Feel like learning Ceylon but you don´t know how to get started? You want to start contributing
to Ceylon so that you can use it in production sooner?

Well don´t worry then, we can help you.

Gavin, Emmanuel and I will be at Devoxx Belgium 2012 for two important gigs:

## Hands-On Lab on Monday 12th of November

On Monday 12th of November we are holding a [Hands-On Lab](http://devoxx.com/display/DV12/Write+your+first+Ceylon+program+with+the+language+authors)
where you can come with your laptop and we´ll help you install the Ceylon IDE, and start writing your first Ceylon programs
with a series of exercises that we´ll help you achieve. This should be interesting, after all, since the language authors
and implementers will be there to answer your every question.

## HackerGarten on Tuesday 13th of November

On Tuesday 13th of November we will be holding a [full-day HackerGarten](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/2012/09/25/More+Space+and+Content)
with the [rest of the JBoss team](http://lanyrd.com/2012/devoxx/syzdq/). Here we will not only help you get started with coding in Ceylon but also help you get
started with contributing to the Ceylon project, and its many sub-projects. If you want to contribute but don´t
know how to get started, then getting help from the people behind the language implementation should make this
a breeze.

## Some planning required

Make sure to [register for the University part of Devoxx](https://reg.devoxx.com/): there are still tickets left.
Also remember to bring your laptop for both those occasions if you want to make the best of these gigs. We´ll
provide the programs required for installation via WiFi or USB keys.
