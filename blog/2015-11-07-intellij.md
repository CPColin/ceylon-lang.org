We've had many questions about developing Ceylon in IntelliJ IDEA,
so I thought it would be worth a quick status update. As you might
know, Ceylon already has the most [feature rich IDE][IDE] of any 
modern language for the JVM, with some features that even the Java
IDE for Eclipse doesn't have. But IntelliJ users don't like having 
to switch to Eclipse when they code Ceylon, so a few months ago we 
got serious about porting Ceylon IDE to Eclipse. Bastien Jansen is 
working on this fulltime, together with David Festal from 
[SERLI](http://www.serli.com/).

The approach they're taking is to refactor reusable functionality
of Ceylon IDE out into a separate project [ceylon-ide-common][].
Simultaneously they're rewriting the common code in Ceylon (which
David reports is really helping simplify and improve the code). 
Then this "abstracted" code is reused in the [ceylon-ide-intellij][]
project, which is also being written in Ceylon, enabling us to get 
some really sophisticated functionality into place very quickly.

Even better, once `ceylon-ide-common` is stabilized, we can reuse 
it elsewhere, for example, in the [Web IDE][], or in a new plugin
for NetBeans.

This also all demonstrates just how well Ceylon's Java interop
works in practice. Here we have Java calling Ceylon and Ceylon 
calling back to Java all over the place!

The IntelliJ plugin isn't really usable just yet, since David is
still working on abstraction of the Ceylon IDE incremental builder,
but we expect to have a first release in a handful of months.

Ceylon IDE for IntelliJ already features completion:

<div style="text-align:center;">
<img alt="completion" src="/images/screenshots/intellij/completion.png" width="80%"/>
</div>

Including linked mode argument completion:

<div style="text-align:center;">
<img alt="linked mode" src="/images/screenshots/intellij/linked-mode.png" width="50%"/>
</div>

Outline view and hover:

<div style="text-align:center;">
<img alt="outline" src="/images/screenshots/intellij/outline.jpg" width="40%"/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt="hover" src="/images/screenshots/intellij/doc.jpg" width="45%"/>
</div>

Live error reporting:

<div style="text-align:center;">
<img alt="errors" src="/images/screenshots/intellij/errors.jpg" width="80%"/>
</div>

And execution:

<div style="text-align:center;">
<img alt="run" src="/images/screenshots/intellij/run.png" width="40%"/>
</div>

Much more functionality is coming soon!
