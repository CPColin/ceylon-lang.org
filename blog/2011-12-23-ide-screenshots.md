Gavin has just created a very nice set of screenshots picturing what our IDE is capable of. Have a look
at it, [a picture is worth a thousand words][screenshots] so imagine 13!

[More info on the IDE][ide]

I also wanted to point out that with the [release of Milestone 1][release], we have opened up 
the user centered [forum][user forum] on Google groups. Come join the fun and feel
free to ask any questions, comments etc we want to know what you think and what we need to improve.
