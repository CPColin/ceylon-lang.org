Today, we're proud to announce a dedicated Ceylon community, 
[ceylon-lang.org](http://ceylon-lang.org). Simultaneously,
we're opening up access to our [git repositories](/code/source/)
and even providing a special pre-release build of the 
[Ceylon IDE](/documentation/1.0/ide), only for the truly 
adventurous.

We're not yet quite ready to release 
[Milestone 1](/documentation/1.0/roadmap/), due to a number of
unsolved bugs and integration issues. But we're working really 
hard to get these sorted out!

I'm taking this opportunity to thank Red Hat's James Cobb for 
the web design, Emmanuel Bernard for setting up the 
infrastructure behind this site, and Tom Bentley for helping
with much of the content. And, while I'm mentioning people's
names, I would also like to thank new hires Stef Ã‰pardaud and 
Tako Schotanus for all the work they did getting the compiler
up and running as volunteer contributors before coming on 
board, and David Festal from SERLI for making the IDE happen.

If *you're* interested in contributing to Ceylon, now is a
really great time to [get involved](/code)!
