Six months after the last minor release,
[Ceylon 1.3.0][download] is a new major release, with over [320 issues][] closed,
including new features, improvements and bug fixes such as:

- TODO: FILL ME IN

Note that for the JVM backend, this release is backwards-compatible
with the previous releases (`1.2.0` to `1.2.2`), which means you can use
modules compiled with `1.2.0` on a `1.3.0` distribution out of the box.
This is not as easy the other way around, if you want to run modules
compiled for `1.3.0` on a `1.2.0` distribution, which is why we 
recommend you upgrade to `1.3.0`.

For the JS backend, this release is backwards-compatible
only with the previous release (`1.2.2`).

## About Ceylon

Ceylon is a modern, modular, statically typed programming 
language for the Java and JavaScript virtual machines. The
language features a flexible and very readable syntax, a 
unique and uncommonly elegant static type system, a powerful 
module architecture, and excellent tooling, including an 
awesome Eclipse-based IDE.

Ceylon enables the development of cross-platform modules 
that execute portably in both virtual machine environments. 
Alternatively, a Ceylon module may target one or the other 
platform, in which case it may interoperate with native code 
written for that platform.

## In the box

[This release][download] includes:

- a complete [language specification][spec] that defines the 
  syntax and semantics of Ceylon in language accessible to 
  the professional developer,
- a [command line toolset][toolset] including compilers for 
  Java and JavaScript, a documentation compiler, a test 
  runner, a WAR archive packager, and support for executing 
  modular programs on the JVM and Node.js,
- a powerful module architecture for code organization,
  dependency management, and module isolation at runtime,
- the [language module][ceylon.language], our minimal, 
  cross-platform foundation of the [Ceylon SDK][sdk], and
- two [full-featured][ide features] integrated 
  development environment: for Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.

## Language

Ceylon is a highly understandable object-oriented language 
with static typing. The language features:

- an emphasis upon __readability__ and a strong bias toward 
  __omission or elimination of potentially-harmful or 
  potentially-ambiguous constructs__ and toward highly 
  __disciplined use of static types__,
- an extremely powerful and uncommonly elegant type system 
  combining subtype and parametric polymorphism with:
  - first-class __union and intersection types__, 
  - both __declaration-site and use-site variance__, and
  - the use of principal types for __local type inference__ 
    and __flow-sensitive typing__,
- a unique treatment of __function and tuple types__, 
  enabling powerful abstractions, along with the most 
  __elegant approach to `null`__ of any modern language, 
- first-class constructs for defining __modules and 
  dependencies between modules__,
- a very flexible syntax including __comprehensions__ and 
  support for expressing __tree-like structures__,
- __fully-reified generic types__, on both the JVM and
  JavaScript virtual machines, and a unique __typesafe 
  metamodel__.

More information about these language features may be
found in the [feature list](/features) and 
[quick introduction][quick-intro].

## Ceylon IDE for Eclipse

Ceylon IDE for Eclipse now features the following improvement, along
with bugfixes:

- TODO: FILL ME IN

## Ceylon IDE for IntelliJ IDEA

Ceylon IDE for IntelliJ is new:

- TODO: FILL ME IN

## SDK

The [platform modules][sdk], recompiled for 1.3.0, are 
available in the shared community repository, [Ceylon Herd][].

This release introduces a single new platform module:

- TODO: FILL ME IN

Along with some enhancements to existing modules:

- TODO: FILL ME IN

## Web IDE

You can try Ceylon using the [Web IDE][], featuring syntax highlighting, 
interactive error reporting, autocompletion, online 
documentation, and persistence and code sharing via Gist.

The Web IDE serves a dual purpose as a standard example
demonstrating the use of Ceylon for web application 
development and deployment to the [OpenShift][] cloud 
platform.

## Community

The Ceylon community site, <http://ceylon-lang.org>, includes 
[documentation][], and information about 
[getting involved][community].

## Source code

The source code for Ceylon, its specification, and its website,
is freely available from [GitHub][git].

Information about Ceylon's open source licenses is available 
[here][license].

## Issues

Bugs and suggestions may be reported in GitHub's 
[issue tracker][issues].

## Migrating from Ceylon 1.2.2

Migration from Ceylon 1.2.2 is easy. To recompile a module for 
1.3.0:

- First ensure that its dependencies have also been 
  recompiled.
- If it imports a Ceylon SDK platform module, upgrade the 
  version number specified by the module `import` statement 
  from `"1.2.2"` to `"1.3.0"` .
- If it was compiled against Ceylon `1.2.2` you should still
  be able to use it in `1.3.0` for the JVM and JS backends.
