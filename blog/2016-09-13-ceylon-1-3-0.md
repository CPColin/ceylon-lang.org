[Ceylon 1.3.0][download] is a major release of the Ceylon
language, with over [330 issues][] closed. This is the first
release of Ceylon which supports [Android][] development and
the Node Package Manager (npm).
 
- For the JVM, this release is backwards-compatible with the 
all releases of Ceylon 1.2 (1.2.0 to 1.2.2).

- For JavaScript, this release is backwards-compatible only 
with the previous release (1.2.2).

Ceylon IDE 1.3.0 is now available for the two leading Java
development environments:

- for the very first time, as a plugin for [IntelliJ IDEA][]
  and [Android Studio][], alongside 
- existing support for the [Eclipse][] platform.

[Ceylon IDE for IntelliJ][] was designed for high performance in
large projects with many Java dependencies, and is currently
the best-performing IDE for Ceylon. 

### Changes

Enhancements to the language and command-line distribution 
include:

- support for developing [Android][] applications
- support for importing modules from [npm][] and for 
  publishing Ceylon modules to npm
- support for developing microservices with 
  [WildFly Swarm][Swarm] 
- addition of the `fat-jar` tool for packaging a Ceylon
  program and its dependencies into a since assembly
- *much* slimmer runtime
- destructuring in `case`s of a `switch`
- addition of the `CorrespondenceMutator` interface
- addition of `Collection.combinations()`
- `small` and `since` annotations
- many minor improvements to Java interop
- improved behavior for `is` tests with generic Java types
- full support for Java 8
- reduced typechecker memory footprint

Naturally, the release incorporates many more bugfixes, 
minor enhancements, and performance improvements.

### IDE Changes

[Ceylon IDE for IntelliJ][] is a brand-new development tool for
IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio, featuring incremental error
reporting, code completion, basic refactoring, 
many intention actions, sophisticated navigation, searching,
type hierarchy and file structure, online documentation, 
full integration with [Ceylon Herd][] and much, much more.

Ceylon IDE for IntelliJ is written mostly in Ceylon, and 
reuses the [Ceylon IDE Common][] project, the core of 
[Ceylon IDE for Eclipse][], which was completely rewritten 
in Ceylon.

### Migration from Ceylon 1.2.2

Ceylon 1.3.0 is backward-compatible with Ceylon 1.2.2, and
so it's not necessary to recompile or change dependencies.
However, upgrading to version 1.3.0 of any Ceylon platform 
module is recommended.

## About Ceylon

Ceylon is a modern, modular, statically typed programming 
language for the Java and JavaScript virtual machines. The
language features a flexible and very readable syntax, a 
unique and uncommonly elegant static type system, a powerful 
module architecture, and excellent tooling, including an 
awesome IDE supporting both IntelliJ IDEA and the Eclipse
platform.

Ceylon enables the development of cross-platform modules 
that execute portably in both virtual machine environments. 
Alternatively, a Ceylon module may target one or the other 
platform, in which case it may interoperate with native code 
written for that platform.

### In the box

[This release][download] includes:

- a complete [language specification][spec] that defines the 
  syntax and semantics of Ceylon in language accessible to 
  the professional developer,
- a [command line toolset][toolset] including compilers for 
  Java and JavaScript, a documentation compiler, a test 
  runner, a WAR archive packager, and support for executing 
  modular programs on the JVM and Node.js,
- a powerful module architecture for code organization,
  dependency management, and module isolation at runtime,
- the [language module][ceylon.language], our minimal, 
  cross-platform foundation of the [Ceylon SDK][sdk], and
- two full-featured integrated development environments: for 
  Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.

### Language

Ceylon is a highly understandable object-oriented language 
with static typing. The language features:

- an emphasis upon __readability__ and a strong bias toward 
  __omission or elimination of potentially-harmful or 
  potentially-ambiguous constructs__ and toward highly 
  __disciplined use of static types__,
- an extremely powerful and uncommonly elegant type system 
  combining subtype and parametric polymorphism with:
  - first-class __union and intersection types__, 
  - both __declaration-site and use-site variance__, and
  - the use of principal types for __local type inference__ 
    and __flow-sensitive typing__,
- a unique treatment of __function and tuple types__, 
  enabling powerful abstractions, along with the most 
  __elegant approach to `null`__ of any modern language, 
- first-class constructs for defining __modules and 
  dependencies between modules__,
- a very flexible syntax including __comprehensions__ and 
  support for expressing __tree-like structures__,
- __fully-reified generic types__, on both the JVM and
  JavaScript virtual machines, and a unique __typesafe 
  metamodel__.

More information about these language features may be
found in the [feature list](/features) and 
[quick introduction][quick-intro].
