This year we are going to participate in the [Google Summer of Code](https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013) 
under the JBoss Community organisation.

We've put together a [page with our proposals](/code/gsoc-2013), so check it out, and if you're a student and would like
to participate in the Ceylon project in a way that will really matter for our users, 
[go apply now](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013).
