# A Ceylon conference in Paris in January 2014

We have so many exciting things to talk about in the Ceylon ecosystem that it's impossible for everyone
to keep track of everything that is happening, but if you live in Paris or not too far from it, we can
help you, because we will organise our first Ceylon Tour conference in Paris in January 2014.

The whole Ceylon team will be there, there will be many short talks, discussions and a workshop. The
conference is free, but availability is limited so we advise you to reserve your ticket as soon as
possible, but only if you're sure to come (it wouldn't be fair to others to reserve a ticket and not come).

Registration, as well as all the info about this conference is detailed on the 
[conference page](/community/conferences/ceylon-tour-paris-2014).

If you live near Paris, any excuse is good to visit Paris, especially a free Ceylon conference :)

If you don't live near Paris, hopefully this is only the start and we will visit your country soon!
