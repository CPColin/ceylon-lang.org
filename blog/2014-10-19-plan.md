With the release of [Ceylon 1.1](/blog/2014/10/09/ceylon-1/), we've 
reached a point where we need to do some serious thinking about what 
are our priorities for the development of Ceylon 1.1.5, 1.2, and 
beyond. I definitely don't yet have a crystal clear vision of what is 
going to be in 1.2, so we're also looking for community feedback on 
this.

I _do_ know of one item which is the top priority right now, and will 
be the main feature of Ceylon 1.1.5:

- [Serialization](https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-spec/issues/704).

This was a feature that slipped from Ceylon 1.0, and which again 
narrowly missed out on inclusion in Ceylon 1.1. The concept behind 
serialization in Ceylon is to have an API responsible for assembling
and disassembling objects that is agnostic as to the actual format of 
the serialized stream. Of course, this API also has to be platform 
neutral, in order to allow serialization between programs running on 
the JVM and programs running on a JavaScript VM. Tom Bentley already 
has a working prototype implementation. Once this feature is done,
we can start working on serialization libraries supporting JSON and
whatever else. 

I also count the following as a high priority areas of work:

- Java EE integration, and support for technologies like JPA and CDI.
- Adding [properties](https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-spec/issues/685) 
  to the language, that is, a new syntax for attribute references, 
  allowing easy MVC UI bindings.
- Improving the Cayla web framework, and `ceylon.html`.

Beyond that, we're not sure where else we should concentrate development 
effort. Here are some things that stick out to me:

- Addition of named 
  [constructors](https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-spec/issues/796), 
  allowing multiple ways to instantiate and initialize a class.
- [AST transformers](https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-compiler/issues/1865)&mdash;a 
  system of compiler plugins, based around `ceylon.ast`, enabling 
  advanced compile-time metaprogramming, which would form the foundation
  for LINQ-style queries, interceptors and proxies, and autogeneration 
  of `equals()`, `hash`, and `string`, and more.
- Addition of a syntax for expressing 
  [patterns in BNF](https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-spec/issues/902).
- The Ceylon plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.
- Android support.
- [Assemblies](https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-spec/issues/667)&mdash;a 
  facility for packaging multiple modules into a deployable 
  "application".
- New platform modules defining `dynamic` interfaces for typesafe 
  interaction with JavaScript APIs such as the DOM, jQuery, etc.
- [Interoperation with dynamic languages on the 
  JVM](https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-compiler/issues/1859), via 
  Ceylon's `dynamic` blocks and `dynamic` interfaces.
- Enabling the use of Ceylon for
  [scripting](https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-spec/issues/200).

We can't do all of this in Ceylon 1.2. Therefore, we're looking for 
feedback from the community. Let us know, here in comments, or on
the mailing list, what you feel is missing from Ceylon, either from
the above list, or whatever else you think is important.
