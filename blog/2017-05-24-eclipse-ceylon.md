We're very excited to announce that Ceylon is going to move to the Eclipse Foundation.

As many of you know, [Red Hat](http://redhat.com) has been the 
[main sponsor](/community/companies/) of Ceylon contributors over the years,
and we're very grateful to Red Hat for pouring so much time and effort kick-starting such
a great language and eco-system as Ceylon in such a short time. I myself am employed by Red Hat.

For many, including me, the Red Hat brand has been synonym to open-source, quality, community,
trust and many other such qualities. But we fear it is an association that may have been
holding back our community, with people expecting Red Hat to be responsible for everything,
and thus prompting people to hold back on contributing and wait rather than participate.

Similarly, some people also hold back from contributing because they may be afraid that Red Hat
“owns” the language (however unjustified), and focus on the company more than on the community.

Joining a Foundation allows us to dispel those fears, by turning Ceylon into a company-neutral
language — which was our goal from the start — and allowing contributors to see it as a neutral
project in which they can participate without fear, and in which they can truly take part and
make a difference.

We feel that thanks to a strong positive experience at Red Hat with the 
[Eclipse Foundation](https://eclipse.org/org/foundation/), this is the Foundation most appropriate to Ceylon. 

Naturally, Red Hat will continue to participate in Ceylon and help it continue to succeed in
being at the fore-front of programming languages, but as equals to other non-Red Hat contributors
in the Eclipse Ceylon project at the Eclipse Foundation.

Head over to the [Eclipse Ceylon project page](https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-ceylon)
to make your voice known in supporting (hopefully) this move by adding comments.

Note that this move is still subject to acceptance by the Eclipse Foundation, and has been several months
in the works, but hopefully everyone will be glad about the move and Eclipse Ceylon will keep
growing further at the Eclipse Foundation.
