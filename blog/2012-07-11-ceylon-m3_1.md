Ceylon M3.1 is now available for download, along with a simultaneous 
compatible release of [Ceylon IDE][].

This release fixes several bugs in the recent M3 release of Ceylon,
and introduces several enhancements.

To the Ceylon language module:

- a whole suite of new operations for working with iterable objects 
  and collections.

And to Ceylon IDE:

- major improvements to the builder in Ceylon IDE, incorporating
  performance enhancements and better support for multi-project
  builds and for intercompilation of Ceylon with Java, and
- cross-project refactoring.

Ceylon M3.1 is otherwise compatible with M3.

You can download the Ceylon command line distribution here:

[http://ceylon-lang.org/download](http://ceylon-lang.org/download?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=web&utm_content=download&utm_campaign=1_0_M3release)

Or you can install Ceylon IDE from Eclipse Marketplace or from our 
[Eclipse update site].

Ceylon M3 and Ceylon IDE M3 require Java 7.
