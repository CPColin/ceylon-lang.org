Today, we're proud to announce the first production 
release of the Ceylon language specification, compiler, 
and IDE. Ceylon 1.0 is a modern, modular, statically 
typed programming language for the Java and JavaScript 
virtual machines. 

Ceylon enables the development of cross-platform modules 
that execute portably in both virtual machine 
environments. Alternatively, a Ceylon module may target
one or the other platform, in which case it may 
interoperate with native code written for the platform.

## In the box

[This release](/download) includes:

- a complete [formal language specification][spec] that 
  defines the syntax and semantics of Ceylon in language 
  accessible to the professional developer,
- a [command line toolset][toolset] including compilers 
  for Java and JavaScript, a documentation compiler, and 
  support for executing modular programs on the JVM and 
  Node.js,
- a powerful module architecture for code organization,
  dependency management, and module isolation at runtime,
- the [language module][ceylon.language], our minimal, 
  cross-platform foundation of the [Ceylon SDK][sdk], and
- a [full-featured][ide features] Eclipse-based 
  integrated development environment.

## Language

Ceylon is a highly understandable object-oriented language 
with static typing. The language features:

- an emphasis upon __readability__ and a strong bias toward 
  __omission or elimination of potentially-harmful constructs__,
- an extremely powerful type system combining subtype and 
  parametric polymorphism with __declaration-site variance__, 
  including first-class __union and intersection types__, and
  using principal types for __local type inference__ and 
  __flow-sensitive typing__,
- a unique treatment of __function and tuple types__, enabling
  powerful abstractions,
- first-class constructs for defining __modules and 
  dependencies between modules__,
- a very flexible syntax including __comprehensions__ and 
  support for expressing __tree-like structures__, and
- __fully-reified generic types__, on both the JVM and
  JavaScript virtual machines, and a unique __typesafe 
  metamodel__.

More information about these language features may be
found in the [feature list](/features) and 
[quick introduction](/documentation/1.0/introduction/).

This release does not introduce new language features.
However, a very large number of bugs have been fixed.

## IDE

Screenshots of the IDE may be [seen here][ide features].

This release of the IDE introduces the following new
features:

- a __type hierarchy view__, to complement the popup type
  hierarchy,
- a __documentation view__, to complement the documentation
  hover, 
- a new __Ceylon Module properties page__, and the ability
  to __manage dependencies__ from this page or from the
  New Ceylon Module wizard,
- enhancements to the search results view, 
- improvements to syntax highlighting in the hover,
- a much improved __wizard for importing Java archives into 
  Ceylon module repositories__, and
- many bugfixes.

## Community module repository

[Ceylon Herd] is now open to the public.

## SDK

The [platform modules][sdk], recompiled for 1.0.0, are available 
in the shared community repository, [Ceylon Herd][].

This release introduces the following new platform modules:

- `ceylon.build`, a framework for writing __build scripts__ in
  Ceylon, and
- `ceylon.html`, a library for defining __HTML content__ in
  Ceylon.

## Community

The Ceylon community site, <http://ceylon-lang.org>, includes 
[documentation][], and information about [getting involved](/community).

## Source code

The source code for Ceylon, its specification, and its website 
is freely available from [GitHub](https://github.com/ceylon).

## Issues

Bugs and suggestions may be reported in GitHub's 
[issue tracker](/code/issues).
