St√©phane and I have been interviewed in [Les Cast Codeurs Podcast][lcc]. We 
casually discuss Ceylon for a little more than an hour. We touched on the philosophy
of the language,  dived in some of the features and discussed the future and the
community.

The only catch is that we talk in French. Now you have to learn two new languages :)

You can listen to the [Ceylon episode directly][ep-56] or see it in [iTunes][itunes].
