[Ceylon 1.3.1][download] is a significant minor release of 
the Ceylon language, with over [140 issues][] closed. This 
is the first release of Ceylon which supports interoperation
with Java 8 lambdas and [streams][], with [RxJava][], and 
with [Spring Boot][]. This release also introduces support 
for [`static` members][].
 
This release of Ceylon has been tested with a wide variety 
of Java libraries and frameworks, including:

- [Spring Boot][],
- WildFly and [WildFly Swarm][],
- [Hibernate][] (JPA),
- [RESTEasy][] (JAXB and JAX-RS),
- [Weld][] (CDI) and [Guice][],
- Eclipse Equinox, Apache Karaf, and Apache Felix (OSGi),
- [Spark][],
- [RxJava][], and
- [Android][].

Example code demonstrating the use of these frameworks is 
[available][examples].

Compared to previous releases of Ceylon, the use of Java 
frameworks based on reflection is now much more transparent, 
and integration with multi-module Maven-based platforms and 
frameworks is now much easier to configure.

The Ceylon [tour][] has been extensively updated, especially 
the sections addressing interoperation with native 
[Java][Java interop] and [JavaScript][JavaScript interop], 
and with the [module system][].

### Changes

Enhancements to the language and command-line distribution 
include:

- [`static` members][] in Ceylon classes
- interoperation with Java 8 lambdas&mdash;ability to pass 
  [Ceylon functions to Java SAM types][]
- [local `import`][] statements
- support for spread operators `*` and `*.` with 
  `java.lang.Iterable` and Java arrays
- literal [tuples in `case`s][] of a `switch`
- [`small Character`s][]
- new Maven interop mode `--fully-export-maven-dependencies`
  for projects depending on multi-module platforms like 
  Spring Boot
- support for POM-only Maven artifacts
- new [Java EE-friendly compiler mode][EE mode], making it
  easy to use Java frameworks that depend on reflective
  direct access to fields
- ability to pass Ceylon metamodel to Java methods accepting 
  `java.lang.Class`
- ability to pass Ceylon strings to Java methods accepting 
  `java.lang.CharSequence`
- [improved treatment of `null` values][unchecked nulls] 
  originating in calls to native Java
- several bugfixes to relating to interop with overloaded 
  Java methods
- new command line options: `--java`, `--incremental`, and
  `--include-dependencies`

Naturally, the release incorporates many more bugfixes and
minor enhancements.

### IDE Changes

Ceylon IDE 1.3.1 for [IntelliJ][Ceylon IDE for IntelliJ] and
[Eclipse][Ceylon IDE for Eclipse] resolves more than 
[110 issues][], and adds support for running and debugging 
Ceylon programs on [WildFly Swarm][].

### SDK Changes

Exactly [15 issues][] affecting the Ceylon SDK have been 
fixed, and the new platform modules `ceylon.interop.spring`
and `ceylon.interop.persistence` were introduced. New 1.3.1 
releases of the platform modules are available in [Herd][].

### Migration

- For the JVM, this release is backwards-compatible with all
  previous releases of Ceylon since 1.2.0.

- For JavaScript, this release is backwards-compatible only 
  with the previous two releases (1.2.2 and 1.3.0).

Ceylon 1.3.1 is backward-compatible with Ceylon 1.3.0, and
so it's not necessary to recompile or change dependencies.
However, upgrading to version 1.3.1 of any Ceylon platform 
module is recommended.

## About Ceylon

Ceylon is a modern, modular, statically typed programming 
language for the Java and JavaScript virtual machines. The
language features a flexible and very readable syntax, a 
unique and uncommonly elegant static type system, a powerful 
module architecture, and excellent tooling, including an 
awesome IDE supporting both IntelliJ IDEA and the Eclipse
platform.

Ceylon enables the development of cross-platform modules 
that execute portably in both virtual machine environments. 
Alternatively, a Ceylon module may target one or the other 
platform, in which case it may interoperate with native code 
written for that platform.

### In the box

[This release][download] includes:

- a complete [language specification][spec] that defines the 
  syntax and semantics of Ceylon in language accessible to 
  the professional developer,
- a [command line toolset][toolset] including compilers for 
  Java and JavaScript, a documentation compiler, a test 
  runner, a WAR archive packager, a "fat" JAR packager, and 
  support for executing modular programs on the JVM and 
  Node.js,
- a powerful module architecture for code organization, 
  dependency management, and module isolation at runtime, 
  which also supports interoperation with OSGi, Jigsaw, 
  Maven, and npm, and
- the [language module][ceylon.language], our minimal, 
  cross-platform, foundation-level API.

Available separately:

- updated versions of the platform modules that comprise the
  [Ceylon SDK][sdk],
- a plugin for the `ceylon` command that supports 
  [compilation and execution for the Dart VM][dart],
- a plugin [packager][swarm] for [WildFly Swarm][],
- a plugin code [formatter][] as a plugin,
- two full-featured integrated development environments: for 
  Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA, and
- a plugin for [Visual Studio Code][vscode].

### Language

Ceylon is a highly understandable object-oriented language 
with static typing. The language features:

- an emphasis upon __readability__ and a strong bias toward 
  __omission or elimination of potentially-harmful or 
  potentially-ambiguous constructs__ and toward highly 
  __disciplined use of static types__,
- an extremely powerful and uncommonly elegant type system 
  combining subtype and parametric polymorphism with:
  - first-class __union and intersection types__, 
  - both __declaration-site and use-site variance__, and
  - the use of principal types for __local type inference__ 
    and __flow-sensitive typing__,
- a unique treatment of __function and tuple types__, 
  enabling powerful abstractions, along with the most 
  __elegant approach to `null`__ of any modern language, 
- first-class constructs for defining __modules and 
  dependencies between modules__,
- a very flexible syntax including __comprehensions__ and 
  support for expressing __tree-like structures__,
- __fully-reified generic types__, on both the JVM and
  JavaScript virtual machines, and a unique __typesafe 
  metamodel__.
