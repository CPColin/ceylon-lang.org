One of the exciting new features coming to the Ceylon SDK in M5 
is the HTTP server contributed by Matej Lazar. The HTTP server
forms part of the module `ceylon.net` and is based on 
[Undertow](https://github.com/undertow-io/undertow), a fairly 
new project that will serve up HTTP in future versions of JBoss.

The API is still evolving, but I can give you a taste of it with 
a little hello world program.

    import ceylon.net.httpd { createServer, Endpoint, Response, Request }
    
    void runServer() {
        //create a HTTP server
        value server = createServer {
            //an endpoint, on the path /hello
            Endpoint { 
                path = "/hello";
                //handle requests to this path
                service(Request request, Response response) =>
                        response.writeString("hello world");
            }
        };
        
        //start the server on port 8080
        server.start(8080);
    }

Or, if you're the kind of person who gets their kicks out of 
squeezing things into one line:

    import ceylon.net.httpd { createServer, Endpoint, Response, Request }
    
    void runServer() => 
            createServer { Endpoint("/hello", 
                    (Request request, Response response) =>
                            response.writeString("hello world")) }
            .start(8080);

(No, FTR, I would _never_ write it like that.)

Oh, I almost forgot, you'll also need to import `ceylon.net` in 
your module descriptor:

    module hellohttp '1' {
        import ceylon.net '0.5';
    }

Of course, what you _don't_ need is any kind of XML metadata or 
build script to package stuff up into deployment archives or 
copy archives to a deployment directory.

And it starts up _in an instant_, right from the commandline
or IDE.
