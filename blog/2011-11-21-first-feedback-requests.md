A Feedback Request is our new way of asking for input from the
community on design issues that we're uncertain about. I
created the first two feeback requests over the weekend:

1. [Syntax for inline functions and objects](https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-spec/issues/54)
2. [Alternate visibility model](https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-spec/issues/56)

Please join in the discussions! The decisions we make on these
issues will be incorporated into the [Milestone 2 release](/documentation/1.0/roadmap/#milestone_2).
