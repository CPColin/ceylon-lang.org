I just added a bunch of new material to the [language design
FAQ](/documentation/1.0/faq/language-design/). This document is
necessarily opinionated, since by nature it represents _our_
reasons for designing _this_ language the way we did, but 
I've tried to keep it as objective as possible. Of course, 
aesthetic considerations are _always_ also important in the
design of any language, library, or framework.

I've added several new sections about the type system, 
including material on:

* [overloading](/documentation/1.0/faq/language-design/#overloading)
* [implicit type conversions](/documentation/1.0/faq/language-design/#implicit_type_conversions)
* [type constructor parameterization](/documentation/1.0/faq/language-design/#type_constructor_parameterization)
* [generalized algebraic types](/documentation/1.0/faq/language-design/#generalized_algebraic_types)
* [checked exceptions](/documentation/1.0/faq/language-design/#checked_exceptions)
* [extension methods](/documentation/1.0/faq/language-design/#extension_methods)
* [functional programming](/documentation/1.0/faq/language-design/#functional_programming)

Please help me out here: what's missing from this document?
What questions do you have about Ceylon _aren't_ answered 
here? Which responses don't make sense?
