After more than three years of development, Ceylon is now 
feature-complete. Ceylon 1.0 beta&mdash;also known as 
M6&mdash;implements the whole [language specification][spec],
and provides the capability to execute Ceylon programs on
both Java and JavaScript virtual machines, and interoperate
with native code written for those platforms. This release
includes:

- a complete [formal language specification][spec] that 
  defines the syntax and semantics of Ceylon in language 
  accessible to the professional developer,
- a [command line toolset][toolset] including compilers 
  for Java and JavaScript, a documentation compiler, and 
  support for executing modular programs on the JVM and 
  Node.js,
- a powerful module architecture for code organization,
  dependency management, and module isolation at runtime,
  and
- the [language module][ceylon.language], our minimal, 
  cross-platform foundation of the [Ceylon SDK][sdk].

Simultaneously, we're releasing Ceylon IDE 1.0 beta, the
latest iteration of our [full-featured][ide features]
Eclipse-based development environment.

## New features of the language

This release introduces the following new language features,
along with many bugfixes:

- annotations and annotation constraints,
- a typesafe metamodel,
- "static" method and attribute references,
- `try` with resources,
- the `**` scaling multiplication operator,
- nonempty variadic parameters, and
- a new improved syntax for calling concrete 
  members of inherited interfaces.

The new features are summarized 
[here](/blog/2013/07/25/progress-report/).
  
## New features of the IDE

This release of the IDE introduces performance improvements,
many bugfixes, and:

- support for launching Ceylon programs on the module
  runtime,
- paste-with-imports, and autoindentation on paste,
- integration with Eclipse's built-in file and package
  refactorings,
- inline "linked-mode" rename, and rename support for
  references in documentation strings,
- improvements to autocompletion, including "linked-mode" 
  argument completion,
- much improved integration for Eclipse's merge viewer,
- integration with the commandline toolset's configuration
  file format,
- several new quick fixes and assists, and 
- a new editor preferences page.
