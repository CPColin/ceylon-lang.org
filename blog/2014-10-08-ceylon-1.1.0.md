Ten whole months in the making, this is the biggest release
of Ceylon so far! [Ceylon 1.1.0][] incorporates oodles of 
enhancements and bugfixes, with well over [1400 issues][] 
closed.

Ceylon is a modern, modular, statically typed programming 
language for the Java and JavaScript virtual machines. The
language features a flexible and very readable syntax, a 
unique and uncommonly elegant static type system, a powerful 
module architecture, and excellent tooling, including an 
awesome Eclipse-based IDE.

Ceylon enables the development of cross-platform modules 
that execute portably in both virtual machine environments. 
Alternatively, a Ceylon module may target one or the other 
platform, in which case it may interoperate with native code 
written for that platform.

For the end user, the most significant improvements in 
Ceylon 1.1 are:

- __performance enhancements__, especially to compilation 
  times in the IDE,
- even smoother __interoperation with Java overloading and 
  Java generics__,
- out of the box support for deployment of __Ceylon modules 
  on OSGi containers__,
- enhancements to the Ceylon SDK, including the __new 
  platform modules__ `ceylon.promise`, `ceylon.locale`, and 
  `ceylon.logging`, along with many improvements to 
  `ceylon.language`, `ceylon.collection`, and `ceylon.test`,
- many new features and improvements in __Ceylon IDE__, 
  including
- `ceylon.formatter`, a high-quality __code formatter__ 
  written in Ceylon, and
- [integration with vert.x](https://github.com/vert-x/mod-lang-ceylon). 

A longer list of changes may be found 
[here](/blog/2014/08/10/progress-report/).

## In the box

[This release](/download) includes:

- a complete [formal language specification][spec] that 
  defines the syntax and semantics of Ceylon in language 
  accessible to the professional developer,
- a [command line toolset][toolset] including compilers 
  for Java and JavaScript, a documentation compiler, and 
  support for executing modular programs on the JVM and 
  Node.js,
- a powerful module architecture for code organization,
  dependency management, and module isolation at runtime,
- the [language module][ceylon.language], our minimal, 
  cross-platform foundation of the [Ceylon SDK][sdk], and
- a [full-featured][ide features] Eclipse-based 
  integrated development environment.

## Language

Ceylon is a highly understandable object-oriented language 
with static typing. The language features:

- an emphasis upon __readability__ and a strong bias toward 
  __omission or elimination of potentially-harmful or 
  potentially-ambiguous constructs__ and toward highly 
  __disciplined use of static types__,
- an extremely powerful and uncommonly elegant type system 
  combining subtype and parametric polymorphism with:
  - first-class __union and intersection types__, 
  - both __declaration-site and use-site variance__, and
  - the use of principal types for __local type inference__ 
    and __flow-sensitive typing__,
- a unique treatment of __function and tuple types__, 
  enabling powerful abstractions, along with the most 
  __elegant approach to `null`__ of any modern language, 
- first-class constructs for defining __modules and 
  dependencies between modules__,
- a very flexible syntax including __comprehensions__ and 
  support for expressing __tree-like structures__, and
- __fully-reified generic types__, on both the JVM and
  JavaScript virtual machines, and a unique __typesafe 
  metamodel__.

More information about these language features may be
found in the [feature list](/features) and 
[quick introduction](/documentation/1.1/introduction/).

This release introduces the following new language features:

- support for __use-site variance__, enabling complete 
  interop with Java generics,
- __`dynamic` interfaces__, providing a typesafe way to 
  interoperate with dynamically typed native JavaScript code,
- __type inference for parameters of anonymous functions__ 
  that occur in an argument list, and
- a __`Byte` class__ that is optimized by the compiler.

## Language module

The language module was a major focus of attention in this
release, with substantial performance improvements, API
optimizations, and new features, including the addition of
a raft of powerful operations for working with streams.

The language module is now considered stable, and no further
breaking changes to its API are contemplated.

## IDE

This release of the IDE features dramatic improvements to
build performance, and introduces many new features, 
including:

- a __code formatter__,
- seven __new refactorings__ and many improvements to existing
  refactorings,
- many __new quick fixes/assists__,
- IntelliJ-style __"chain completion"__ and completion of toplevel 
  functions applying to a value,
- a rewritten __Explorer view__, with better presentation of modules
  and modular dependencies,
- synchronization of all keyboard accelerators with JDT 
  equivalents,
- Quick Find References, Recently Edited Files, Format Block,
  Visualize Modular Dependencies, Open in Type Hierarchy View, 
  Go to Refined Declaration, and much more.


## SDK

The [platform modules][sdk], recompiled for 1.1.0, are 
available in the shared community repository, [Ceylon Herd][].

This release introduces the following new platform modules:

- `ceylon.promise`, cross-platform support for __promises__,
- `ceylon.locale`, a cross-platform library for 
   __internationalization__, and
- `ceylon.logging`, a simple __logging API__.

In addition, there were many improvements to 
`ceylon.collection`, which is now considered stable, and to
`ceylon.test`.

The Ceylon SDK is available from [Ceylon Herd], the community
module repository.

## Vert.x integration

`mod-lang-ceylon` implements Ceylon 1.1 support for 
Vert.x 2.1.x, and may be downloaded 
[here](https://github.com/vert-x/mod-lang-ceylon/releases/).

[documentation][], and information about [getting involved](/community).

## Source code

The source code for Ceylon, its specification, and its website 
is freely available from [GitHub](https://github.com/ceylon).
